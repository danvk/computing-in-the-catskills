"""Find minimum hiking distance, requiring loop hikes."""

# Each node is a (trailhead, peak) pair, where the trailhead is where you parked your car.
# Each nodeset is (*, peak)
# Traveling from (A, X) to (B, Y) requires traveling:
# - From X to A on trails
# - From A to B by car
# - From B to Y on trails

# Plan of attack:
# âœ“ Form a new graph consisting of (trailhead, peak) pairs; Trailhead nodes are left as-is.
# - Attach the artificial zero node and produce a complete graph.
# - Run GTSP over this complete graph w/ relevant nodesets.
# - Map this back to a sequence of hikes
# - Visualize
